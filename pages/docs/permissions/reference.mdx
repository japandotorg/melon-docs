## How it works

When loaded, the permissions cog will allow you to define extra custom rules for who can use a command.

If no applicable rules are found, the command will behave normally.

Rules can also be added to cogs, which will affect all commands from that cog. The cog name can be found from the help menu.

## Rule priority

Rules set for subcommands will take precedence over rules set for the parent commands, which lastly take precedence over rules set for the cog. So for example, if a user is denied the `Warnings` cog, but allowed the `[p]warn` command, the user will not be able to use any command in the `Warnings` cog except for `[p]warn`.

In terms of scope, global rules will be checked first, then server rules.

For each of those, the first rule pertaining to one of the following models will be used:

- User
- Voice Channel
- Text Channel
- Channel Category
- Roles, highest to lowest
- Server (can only be in global rules) [Developer]
- Default rules

In private messages, only global rules about a user will be checked.

## Settings Rules From A File

The permissions cog can also set, display or update rules with a YAML file with the `[p]permissions yaml` command. Models must be represented by ID. Rules must be `true` for allow, or `false` for deny.
Here is an example:

```yaml
COG:
  Admin:
    954636730110210048: true
    960457765942329354: false
  Warnings:
    954636730110210048: true
    default: false
COMMAND:
  cleanup bot:
    954636730110210048: true
    default: false
  ping:
    994480580773285898: false
    default: true
```

## Example configurations

Locking the `[p]warn` command to approved server(s) as a bot owner:

```
[p]permissions setdefaultglobalrule deny warn
[p]permissions addglobalrule allow warn [server ID or name]
```

Locking the `[p]warn` command to specific voice channel(s) as a serverowner or admin:

```
[p]permissions setdefaultserverrule deny warn
[p]permissions setdefaultserverrule deny "warningset senddm"
[p]permissions addserverrule allow warn [Text channel ID or name]
[p]permissions addserverrule allow "warningset senddm" [Text channel ID or name]
```

Allowing extra roles to use `[p]cleanup`:

```
[p]permissions addserverrule allow cleanup [role ID]
```

Preventing `[p]cleanup` from being used in channels where message history is important:

```
[p]permissions addserverrule deny cleanup [channel ID or mention]
```
