SlashTags also supports adding context menu commands. These can be added with `[p]slashtag user` or `[p]slashtag message`. Context menu commands differ from slash commadns as they are invoked through the `Apps` section on a message/user context menu.

You can only add 5 global and 5 server context menu commands for each type.

## Context Menu Arguments

Context menu commands do not allow for custom argument creation. They do however have two variable that are automatically accessible in the tagscript:

- `{target_id}` - representing the ID of the object context menu that invoked the command
- `{user}` - the user that the command was ran on, if a user command was invoked
- `{message}` - the message that the command was ran on, if a message command was invoked
