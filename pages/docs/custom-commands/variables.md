The following blocks will be present and accessible as defaults when running any tag.

## Meta Variables

Meta variables reference meta attributes about the tag invocation.

### Args Block

The `{args}` block represents the arguments passed after the tag name when invoking a tag. If no parameter is passed, it returns all the text after the invocation name. If an index is passed, it will split the arguments into a list by the given splitter, and return the word at the index. The default splitter is a " ".

**Usage:** `{args([index]):[splitter]}`

**Payload:** splitter

**Parameter:** index

**Example:**

:::note

In the following example, assume the tag's name is `argstag` and the message content is `[p]argstag When life gives you lemons, make lemonade.`

:::

```py
{args}
# When life gives you lemons, make lemonade
{args(1)}
# When life gives you lemons
{args(2):,}
# make lemonade
```
