**FOR ALL COMMANDS THAT HAVE A MESSAGE ARGUMENT**

If you are replying to a giveaway message instead of passing an id or link, you must pass a *fake* value for the `message_id` argument.

This fake value can be literally anything you want.

:::

## Usage

* ### `[p]g cancel`

Cancel a giveaway. This is similar to [`[p]g end`](/docs/giveaways/giveaway#pg-end) but it doesn't go throuhg the complete ending process.
I.E the end message, and dms are not processed. The giveaway message is deleted from the channel and also from bot storage.

**Syntax:** `[p]g cancel [message_id]`

```js title="Example:"
[p]g cancel 12345678901234567890

// or if you want to reply to a message
[p]g cancel x
```

* ### `[p]g create`

This asks you different questions one by one to start a giveaway. ( For Beginners )

* ### `[p]g eligible`

A simple command to check if you are eligible for a giveaway or not.

If you aren't eligible the command will reply with the reason why you aren't eligible.
