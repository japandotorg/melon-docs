Doing something for free has its perks, but it also has its drawbacks. One of the drawbacks is that you don't get paid for your work. This is where donations come in. Donations are a way for people to show their appreciation for your work. They can also be a way to get paid for your work. This is where Donation Logging comes in.

Donation Logging is a way to log donations that you receive. It is a way to keep track of who donated, how much they donated, and when they donated. It is also a way to keep track of what you did for the person who donated.

You might have seen this being done on many other bots on discord, but never in the way that melon does it. Melon has a very unique way of doing it, and it is very easy to use.

Most bots only allow you to log the donations of only one currency. Melon allows you to log donations of multiple currencies. This means that you can log donations of any currency that you want. You can also log donations of multiple currencies at the same time.

They currencies are known as *banks* in melon. You can add as many banks as you want. You can also remove banks if you want to. You can also edit the banks if you want to.

Each bank has two main properties, its name and the emoji associated with it. Each bank is tracked and logged separately and the details of each bank can be viewed separately.

Except for these two main properties, each bank also has a few other properties.
Namely:

1. The log channel
2. Whether the bank is hidden
3. Whether the bank is the default
4. Bank items
5. Bank Milestone roles

All of the above will be explained in details in the next sections.

This cog only has two top-level commands: [`dono`](/docs/donationlogging/dono.md) and [`donoset`](/docs/donationlogging/donoset.md), with a ton of sub commands for extreme customizability.
